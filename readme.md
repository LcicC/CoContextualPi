Type inference for the (TODO: linear) π-calculus with product and sum types (TODO: and recursion/replication).
Type inference here is "co-contextual": given a process `P`, we try to infer `Γ` such that `Γ ⊢ P`.
The context `Γ` is built from the usages in `P`.
The soundness of type inference is intrinsic.
TODO: show that type inference is complete.
